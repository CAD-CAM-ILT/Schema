The ids specification is licensed under the Open Software License version 3.0
1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, 
sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following:
a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work;
b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work, thereby creating 
derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;
c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, 
with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or 
communicate shall be licensed under this Open Software License;
d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
e) to display the Original Work publicly.
2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, 
sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied 
in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, 
sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.
3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the 
Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to 
modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code 
of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor 
reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code 
in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by 
You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.
4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any 
contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to 
endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of 
the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to 
Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No 
patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of 
any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the 
trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this 
License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this 
License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
5) External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution, or 
communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or 
Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or 
communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a 
network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External 
Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).
6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You 
create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as 
well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution 
Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a 
prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the 
Original Work.
7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in 
and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the 
Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the 
contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately 
preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and 
WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-
infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE 
QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an 
essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except 
under this disclaimer.
8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort 
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this 
License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, 
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or 
losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such 
limitation.
9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that 
assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and 
conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You 
must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients 
to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in 
Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing 
so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international 
treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including 
"fair use" or "fair dealing"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer 
exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions 
in Section 1(c).
10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no 
longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an 
action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the 
Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging 
patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.
11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be 
brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor 
conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law 
provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale 
of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or 
after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law 
in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.
12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages 
relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, 
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, 
including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.
13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or 
lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of 
the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled 
by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the 
power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by 
contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, 
or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or 
conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be 
responsible for such uses by You.
16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is 
granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this 
License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. 
However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your 
modified version (the "Modified License") and apply it to other original works of authorship subject 
to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is the 
"Open Software License" or "OSL" and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified 
License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice 
"Licensed under <insert your license name here>" or with a notice of your own that is not 
confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works 
are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source 
Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process.

        Example: &lt;UserData Parameter="HelloWorld" Value="SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ==" Encoding="Base64"/&gt;
        Example: &lt;UserData Parameter="MyDate" Value="02/03/2012" Format="MMDDYYYY"/&gt;
        Index specifies position of the element in a sequence of similar elements to avoid combining name with a number.
        Example: &lt;DataElement Parameter="e-mail" Value="a1@something.com" Index="1"/&gt;
        &lt;DataElement Parameter="e-mail" Value="a2@something.com" Index="2"/&gt;

++  provide a <Notification> message with the results of the Update request so that the 
++  requestor has some confirmation of what was actually done.

The <ProductCatalogs> ids schema is intended to allow trading partners to exchange a catalog defining products that may be 
referenced in various ids transactions or queries.  It allows for multiple catalogs, potentially from different source systems
to be documented and/or exchanged.

<ProductCatalogs> is a wrapping or container element that holds the collection of catalogs. (required) 

<ProductCatalog> is a single specific Product Catalog with one or more products defined. (required) 

<Product> i	s the master level defining a product. A "product" consists of one or more unique SKU codes. 
Each SKU code represents a unique combination of product options or "attributes". (one or more required) 
=== @ProductClass attribute is intended to help classify the genre of the products and is an enumerated value. see embedded comment 
below for possible values.

<ProductSKU> represents a unique combination of options or attributes (or properties) of a product. 
(one or more required per product) 

<ProductDescriptions> is a wrapper or containing element that holds one or more descriptions of a ProductSKU. (optional)

<ProductDescription> contains a textual description of a Product or ProductSKU.  (Optional)
=== @ProductDescriptionFormat is an enumerated value that indicates the format the text is in - see embedded comments below for possible values.
=== @ProductDescrciptionIntendedUse is an attribute that can be used to identify how a description is intended to be used (i.e. OnInvoice, Web Page, etc.)

<ProductPricing> is a wrapper or containing element that holds elements that define the prices for the products.(optional)
=== @ProductPriceScheduleCode is an optional attribute that allows multiple price lists to be defined for a product. (optional)
=== @ProductPriceMinimumQty is an optional attribute that allows price-break discounts to be defined for each product SKU/schedule combination. (optional)
=== @ProductPriceAmount is the amount for the SKU/Schedule/Quantity combination (required if node is present)
=== @ProductPriceCurrency defines the currency that the price amount is defined in (optional)

<ProductAttributes> is a wrapper of containing element that holds one or more attributes (or properties) of a product SKU that help define the product SKU. (optional)
	
<ProductAttribute> is an element that can be used to define attributes or properties of a product. (one or more required if <ProductAttributes> node is included).
=== @ProductAttributeName is the identifying name of an attribute
=== @ProductAttributeValue is the value specific to the individual SKU.
=== @ProductAttributeUID is the GUID identifier that uniquely identifies the Attribute - NOT the attribute value. It is expected that all product SKU's 
within a "Product" would share the same collection attributes, differing only by the attribute values. 
Example:  a product may defined as "TitaniumBar" with an attribute of "Size" and two SKU's. One SKU would have a size attribute value of 
"Large" and the other would have an size attribute value of "small".  On both SKU nodes, the ProductAttributeUID and the ProductAttributeName 
should be the same, though the ProductAttributeValue would be different.

<ProductComponents> is a wrapper node that contains one or more <ProductComponent> elements that are used to define a complex product that consists of 
or is created by combining multiple other products. (optional)

<ProductComponent> represents a product, part or component used to create the defined ProductSKU.  (one or more required if <ProductComponents> node exists.
=== @ProductSKUUID is the ProductSKU that is needed/used and should be a reference to an ProductSKUUID that is also defined within the ids Product
catalog document.
=== @ProductSKUQtyMin defines the minimum quantity needed of the referenced SKU component to create the SKU being defined.
=== @ProductSKUQtyMax defines the maximum quantity that can be used of the referenced SKU component to create the SKU being defined.
An example of the above two attributes would be SKU that defines a bag of 10 titanium bars. Since it's a bag it's a pre-sized bag it would have a 
minimum and maximum both set to "10".  However, a product defined as a bridge restoration may have a variable quantity of a specific sub-component 
based on the number of units within the bridge. Another example would be a product that has an "optional" subcomponent, in which case the
minimum may be zero while the max is set to one.
